## Project Description/Summary

This project involves wiring up a simple calculator.

## New Things Learned or Refreshed
    Got to use just data set as an element selector.

## Time to Code

This took about 5 mins to code as i don't mind the html and css code ( taken directly from re source at https://jsbeginners.com/calculator-javascript-project/)

## Biggest Take Away(s)

Hard for me to code just this as it's not a workable calculator but it's a good way to keep in mind that we need to make what it tasked first.
