# 100 javascripts project for beginner
Project based on https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/

but this is my own javascript code and how i will handle it.

What the goal ?
For me, learn by making this project, make search on solution for element I can't handle as it's a part of a developper to be able to find solution.

I encourage you to see and read too the code source and solution on [jsbegginer.com](https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/)
as you will have another solution.
