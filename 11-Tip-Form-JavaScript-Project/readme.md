## Tip form Javasctip project

As for the previous challenge, i don't mind the css and html files.
But for this one, i can let myself know that we can use people sharing
the bill be lower than 1.

So i've changed the input value for a minimum of 1 people paying for the bill :)

The minimum for the bill is set to 0 too.

1/ Select all element needed for the application to work:

    1. id: input-bill
    1. id: input-users
    1. id: input-service
    i. input: type submit

2/ Prevent the default action on submit button

3/ Service has no option. So add some with javascript

4/ Add a disabled/enabled option for the submit button.
